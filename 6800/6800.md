# SWTPC 6800

The system contains:

## Mainboard

1. SWTPC MP-B mainboard with 7 SS-50 and 8 SS-30 "slots"

## SS-50 Bus

1. SWTPC MP-A: CPU board with MIKBUG ROM and some modifications
   - The 110b clock line is connected to the 4800 baud clock output
   - The 150b clock line is connected to the 9600 baud clock output
   - A modification is made including the addition of a 7400 quad nand gate
     piggybacked on IC16, that modifies one of the chip select lines based
     on the value on UD1. What it exactly does is unclear, possibly it has
     to do with the prototyping board containing two EPROMS

2. SWTPC MP-8M2: 8 KByte RAM board (with write protect switch)

3. SWTPC MP-4: 4 KByte RAM board

4. SWTPC MP-4: 4 KByte RAM board

5. (empty)

6. Prototyping boad with some glue logic and two EPROMS with the text
   "E000 E7FF" and "F800 FFFF" on it. The EPROMS seem to actually still contain
   some data.

7. (empty)

## SS-30 Bus

0. Homemade serial port
   Probably based on SWTPC MP-S without the currentloop and reader control 
   support

1. SWTPC MP-C Serial Control Interface: board with currentloop and reader control
   support.
   - Funny note: the RS232 signal is bit-banged via an 6820 parallel interface
     controller
